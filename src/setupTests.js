/* This code is importing the `jest-dom` library which adds custom matchers to Jest for asserting on
DOM nodes. These custom matchers allow you to write more expressive and readable tests for your
React components. The comment provides an example of one of the custom matchers,
`toHaveTextContent`, which allows you to check if an element has a certain text content. The comment
also provides a link to the `jest-dom` GitHub repository where you can learn more about the library. */
